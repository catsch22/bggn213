## Exploring PBD database
Downloaded CSV from “Analyze” -> “PDB Statistics” > “by Experimental Method and Molecular Type
Now as Q of what oercent structures by experimental method. (Remember to keep the intermediate file to show the output once in github online)

```{r}
p <- read.csv("DataExportSummary.csv", row.names=1)
#allows experimental method
p
```

```{r}
sum(p$Total)
percent <- (p$Total / sum(p$Total)) * 100
percent
```

```{r}
names(percent) <-  row.names(p)
percent
```

Here we can see that majority are X-ray in the database
```{r}
